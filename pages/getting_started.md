Are you looking for software or scripts to perform simulations of materials behavior or assist with your analysis of experimental or simulation data? Have you written software or scripts that you would like to disseminate to the community?
If you answered “yes” to either of these questions, matsci.io is the place for you. The goal of matsci.io is to provide a portal for discovery and dissemination of materials science related software and scripts. Within this portal, you will find not only links and information for many of the most frequently used software in the computational material science field, but also unique user-contributed software relevant to experimental and computational materials science.
